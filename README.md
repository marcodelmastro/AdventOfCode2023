# Advent Of Code 2023

* [Day 1](Day01.ipynb). String manipulation with not-so-trivial twist for Part 2.

* [Day 2](Day02.ipynb). First tricky input parsing (if only I resolved to learn `regex`!). List comparison by element (`map`, `all`) in Part 1, matrix rotation with `numpy` in Part 2.

* [Day 3](Day03.ipynb). Ok, today I really needed regular expression! I learned `re.finditer` and that basically solved most of the problem! Part 2 came almost for free from Part1.

* [Day 4](Day04.ipynb). More `regex` to parse the input, `set` intersections to process card value overlaps.
